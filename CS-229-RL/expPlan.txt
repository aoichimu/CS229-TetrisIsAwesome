- try with just one layer 
	- Just have a flatten and dense layer to actions
- plot average Q
	- q(s,a) for every a, take the average

Series of Experiments: 
-Effectiveness of a target network (including not having a target network)
-Complexity of model architecture
  -linear
  -multiple layers
-Frame-skipping (with and without)
-Stacking the information of the frames
-Image inputs vs RAM inputs

Asynchronous? 

- plot average Q

Todo: 
image inputs and stacking

Params:
Network complexity: linear, 3 layers, normal dist (0.01)
Initialization: uniform
Target model: N, 1000, 5000
Frame-skipping: Y, N
